<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user requested a web application for a virtual technical school with three distinct roles: Admin, Professor, and Student.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Admin Role:**
    -   Manages (creates/edits) students, professors, technical programs (tecnicos), and subjects (materias).
    -   Assigns subjects to a specific program.
    -   Assigns students to their respective courses.
    -   Logs in with an email and password.
-   **Professor Role:**
    -   Logs in with an email and password.
    -   Selects a course to manage upon login.
    -   Manages grades for all students in a spreadsheet-like view (students as rows, activities as columns). Grades should be editable.
    -   Creates activities with file attachments (e.g., PDFs), start dates, and due dates. Activities should be automatically numbered (e.g., Act 1, Act 2).
    -   Uploads and manages YouTube links for class videos.
    -   Activities become blocked and cannot be submitted after the due date.
-   **Student Role:**
    -   Logs in with a national ID (cédula) and a password.
    -   Views activities with three states: Not Yet Available, Active, and Blocked (overdue).
    -   Submits assignments by uploading files (photos, PDFs, etc.).
    -   Views grades for each subject and a calculated average.
-   **General:**
    -   The application should be built with React, Vite, JSX, and CSS.
    -   The UI/UX must be very intuitive and simple.
    -   The design should complement the provided logo.
    -   The system should be fully functional (ready to work in the real world) with a database and server.
    -   Provide default user credentials for testing.

**User's preferred language**: Spanish. The next agent MUST respond in Spanish.

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack application has been developed using React for the frontend and Python/FastAPI for the backend, with MongoDB as the database. The application implements the three required user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) with distinct dashboards and functionalities. The backend provides a complete set of APIs for data management and authentication, and the database is populated with comprehensive seed data for testing. The UI is responsive and styled using a custom design system built on Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui.

**Last working item**:
    - Last item agent was working: The agent was implementing three new features requested by the user:
        1.  Allowing students to upload files when submitting an activity.
        2.  Enabling admins to assign a subject to a program during creation/editing.
        3.  Enabling admins to assign a student to courses during creation/editing.
        The agent had written the code for both the frontend and backend and was in the final stages of verifying the changes via screenshots when the browser crashed.
    - Status: IN PROGRESS
    - Agent Testing Done: N (Verification was interrupted).
    - Which testing method agent to use? manual testing by screenshot tool. The agent must first retry the screenshot of the admin subjects page (). After confirming the UI, a full manual test of the three new features is required (admin assigning a subject to a program, admin assigning a student to a course, and a student submitting an activity with a file).
    - User Testing Done: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
  - Issue 1: Incomplete verification of the latest features due to a browser crash. (Priority: P0)

  Issues Detail:
  - Issue 1: 
     - Attempted fixes: None yet, as the crash was the last event. The likely fix is to simply retry the action.
     - Next debug checklist: 
        1. Use the  to capture the admin subjects edit dialog to confirm the Program selector is visible and functional.
        2. Log in as an admin, edit a student, and verify that the Cursos Inscritos (Enrolled Courses) checkboxes appear and can be modified.
        3. Log in as a student, navigate to an active activity, and verify that the file upload dialog appears and allows for file submission.
     - Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix? This will confirm that the latest batch of user requests has been successfully implemented and the application is ready for the user's review.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Is recurring issue? N
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both.
     - Blocked on other issue: None.

**In progress Task List**:
  - Task 1: Complete the verification of the three recently implemented features. (Priority: P0)

 Task Detail:
  - Task 1: 
     - Where to resume: Resume the verification process starting with a  command for the admin subjects page to check the edit dialog. The browser crashed during the last attempt.
     - What will be achieved with this? This will finalize the implementation of the user's latest requests and ensure all new functionality is working as expected.
     - Status: IN PROGRESS
     - Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Both.
     - Blocked on something: Potentially a transient environment issue that caused the browser crash. A retry should resolve it.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
    Upcoming Tasks:
    - (P0) Answer the user's question: What else would the page need to be uploaded [deployed] or is it ready?. This requires providing an explanation of the steps for real-world deployment (hosting, domain, etc.).

    Future Tasks:
    - (P1) Create deployment scripts (e.g., Dockerfiles, ) to simplify the production setup process.
    - (P2) Write comprehensive documentation on how to set up, configure, and deploy the application.

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all API endpoints for the application. Recently updated to allow file uploads by students and course/program assignments.
-   : Crucial for populating the database. It must be run () to test the application.
-   : Defines all frontend routes.
-   : Recently updated to include a file upload dialog for submissions.
-   : Recently updated to include course assignment checkboxes in the create/edit dialog.
-   : Recently updated to include a program selection dropdown in the create/edit dialog.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
- State management logic in larger components like  or  could be extracted into custom React hooks to improve readability and separation of concerns.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Authenticates users and returns a JWT.
-   : Handles file uploads for activities and submissions. Recently updated to grant students access.
-   : Endpoint for student CRUD operations. Recently updated to handle course enrollments.
-   : Endpoint for updating subjects. Recently updated to handle program ID changes.
-   : Endpoint for students to create submissions. Recently updated for file uploads.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The immediate task is to finalize the verification of the latest features, which was interrupted by a browser crash. Start by retrying the screenshot of the admin's subject edit page.
- After verification, the next priority is to answer the user's question about what is needed to deploy the application to a live environment.
- The database must be seeded by running . The application will not function correctly without this initial data.
- The database name is , configured via an environment variable.
