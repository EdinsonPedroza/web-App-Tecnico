# MongoDB Configuration
# NOTE: MONGO_URL is commented out intentionally - the application will use a default value
# of "mongodb://localhost:27017" if not set. This is safe for local development.
# For Railway/Production: Set MONGO_URL in Railway environment variables to your MongoDB connection string
# For local development: Uncomment the line below if you need a different local MongoDB URL
# MONGO_URL="mongodb://localhost:27017"
